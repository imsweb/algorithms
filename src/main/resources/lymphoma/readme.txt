The data for the "Lymphoid Neoplasm Recode" algorithm was taken from the SEER website:

https://seer.cancer.gov/lymphomarecode/


lymphoma-2021revision.csv
The Excel download was saved as CSV and the "-" special dashes were replaced by ASCII dashes.
I also had to manually add the recode to the rows that were "merged" in Excel!


09/12/23 - I manually updated the histology ranges of the lymphoma-2021revision.csv file (changes were not posted online yet).
