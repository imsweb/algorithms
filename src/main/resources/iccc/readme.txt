The data for the "International Classification of Childhood Cancer" algorithm was taken from the SEER website:

https://seer.cancer.gov/iccc/iccc-iarc-2017.html
https://seer.cancer.gov/iccc/iccc-who2008.html
https://seer.cancer.gov/iccc/iccc3.html

The data was created by parsing the HTML from those pages.

09/12/23 - I manually updated the histology ranges of the iccc-data-third-edition-iarc-2017.csv file (changes were not posted online yet).
